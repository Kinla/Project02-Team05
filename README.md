# Project Title

This is a web application that aims to help individuals acheive their goals by setting up binding Commitment Contracts.

Each commitment contract has the following components:
1. Title of the goal
2. Description of the goal
3. Type: one-time or on-going
4. Start date
5. Duration (in weeks) if on-going
6. Referee

   You asign a referee who would have the ultimate power to determine if you are sucessful for each week.
7. Stake

   This is an embarrassing video/photo of yourself that you submit to us. Should you fail to acheive an 80% sucess rate. This information will be emailed to your referee for dispersement.
8. Points (rewarded by UTTR admin)

   If you have met your goal for the week, you will be rewarded 7 points. You can then use these points to enter our UTTR LOTTO. We announce a new winner each week.

The goal-setter would be able to enter comments and submit photos while the goal is in the active state. Each week, the goal-setter is required to self report if they are sucessful on the weekly basis. The sucess status can be updated by the goal's referee should they disagree with goal-setter's self-evaluation.

The commitment contract is marked complete when it reaches the end of contract duration.

For social media users, they can also opt into announcing their progress using their social network. The power of peer support/pressure will increase effectiveness of the contracts.

For details on the view including the user dashboard refer to our latest storyboard: https://balsamiq.cloud/slcxc2l/pdvu3y8/r2278.
